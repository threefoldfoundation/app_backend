In accordance with Article 10 of the original iTFT Purchase Agreement(s) entered into between you as a Purchaser and the Company as a seller, please find the following amendment to the Agreement(s) that needs to be approved and signed by you.

**iTFT Price Adjustment**

After much feedback from the blockchain and cryptocurrency community, we have adjusted the price of the iTFT from USD $5.00 to USD $0.05. This means for the Purchase Amount previously outlined in your Purchase Agreement(s), you will receive more tokens. We are adjusting the total number of iTFTs you are receiving to align with the new iTFT price so you will receive 100 times more tokens. The total nominal value of the iTFTs you received based on that Purchase Agreement(s) will NOT change. As we iterate on our model and should it change again, we may further adjust the volume of iTFTs you receive accordingly.
