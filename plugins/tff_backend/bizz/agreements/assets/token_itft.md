This agreement (hereinafter referred to as the “**Agreement**”) is entered into on **{{ effective_date }}** (the “**Effective Date**”), by and between:

The purchaser mentioned above (the “**Purchaser**”);  
and  
**ThreeFold FZC**, a free zone establishment with License No: 17194 with its principal place of business at Q1-07-038/B SAIF Zone, United Arab Emirates, PO Box 514608; hereinafter referred to as the “**Company**”;

Collectively referred to in this Agreement as the “**Parties**”, each referred to as a “**Party**”.

Before its Private Token Offering (“**PTO**”), the Threefold Foundation is launching an Internal Token Offering (“**ITO**”) for friends, family and ambassadors. In exchange for the payment of the Purchase Amount, the Company hereby issues to the Purchaser certain digital tokens (the “**internal ThreeFold Tokens**” or “**iTFT's**”), which on the occurrence of the PTO will be exchanged against digital tokens of the ThreeFold Foundation (the “**ThreeFold Tokens**” or “**TFT's**”), subject to the terms set forth below.

**1. Conditionality**

The present Agreement is entered into between the Parties subject to the Purchaser’s completion of the Company’s “know-your-customer” verification process (“**KYC**”). Customer agrees to cooperate in good faith with the Company and to provide such information as may be reasonably requested by the Company in order to complete such KYC. The Company reserves the right not to enter into, or to terminate, this Agreement based on any issue that may arise as a result of such KYC (including, but not limited to, possible non-compliance with applicable anti-money laundering legislation).

**2. Internal Token Offering**

Subject to the terms set out hereinafter, including Purchaser’s payment of the entire Purchase Amount, the Company sells and transfers to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser accepts and acquires, the entire rights and title to such number of iTFT's corresponding to the above mentioned Purchase Amount (converted, as the case may be, into US Dollars as per Section 4 below) divided by the Purchase Price.

Upon Company's reasonable request, the Purchaser will provide all information, including a network address to which the iTFT's will be sent upon receipt of the Purchase Amount. The Purchaser will furthermore execute and deliver to the Company any and all other transaction documents related to this Agreement as may be reasonably requested by the Company, including verification of non-US/China/Canada person status under the applicable securities laws.

**3. Exchange against TFT's**

If and when the ThreeFold Foundation’s Private Token Offering takes place, any and all iTFT's held by the Purchaser will automatically be exchanged against a corresponding number of TFT's on the first day of the PTO.  

**4. Lock-up Period**

Unless explicitly agreed to by the Company or the ThreeFold Foundation, Purchaser will not be allowed to sell or transfer the iTFT's purchased under this Agreement for a period of six months after the date of this Agreement. Any TFT’s acquired by Purchaser upon conversion of its iTFT’s into TFT’s shall be made subject to the same lock-up period as the original iTFT’s acquired by Purchaser.

During such six months lock-up period, however, the Purchaser shall still be entitled to:

 - (a)	use the iTFT's and/or TFT's to purchase IT capacity on the ThreeFold Grid through the ThreeFold Directory; and

 - (b)	transfer iTFT's and/or TFT’s to a person or entity that already owns iTFT’s or TFT’s immediately prior to such transfer.

**5. Payment**

The Company will accept payment for the iTFT's purchased under this Agreement in U.S. Dollars, Euro, Pound Sterling, United Arab Emirates Dirham and Bitcoin. Purchaser shall make the required payment to the Company in consideration for Purchaser’s purchase of the iTFT’s pursuant to the Agreement by wire transfer to the Company within three business days. The payment information will be provided in the ThreeFold app.

For purposes of this Agreement, the value of the Purchase Amount shall be deemed in U.S. Dollar even when the Purchaser pays in any of the other currencies mentioned above.

Conversion of other currencies stated above to U.S. Dollars will be made as follows:
- For purchases made in Bitcoin, on the day on which the Bitcoin payment has been received by the Company in its Wallet, the Purchase Amount will be converted in AED first at the conversion rate quoted on the website of BitOasis Technologies FZE, and then immediately thereafter from AED in U.S. Dollars at the conversion rate quoted on the website of Oanda.com, both on such date at 11.59 PM Gulf Standard Time.
- For purchases made in EUR, GBP or AED, the Purchase Amount will be converted in U.S. Dollars at the following conversion rate:
  - 1 U.S. Dollar = {{ conversion['EUR'] }} Euro;
  - 1 U.S. Dollar = {{ conversion['GBP'] }} Pound Sterling;
  - 1 U.S. Dollar = 3.67 United Arab Emirates Dirham.
