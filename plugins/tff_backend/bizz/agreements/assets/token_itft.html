<p>This agreement (hereinafter referred to as the “<b>Agreement</b>”) is entered into on <b>{{ effective_date }}</b> (the
“<b>Effective Date</b>”), by and between:</p>
<p>The purchaser mentioned above (the “<b>Purchaser</b>”);</p>
<p>and</p>
<p><b>Green IT Globe Holdings FZC</b>, a free zone establishment with License No: 17194 with its principal place of business
at Q1-07-038/B SAIF Zone, United Arab Emirates, PO Box 514608; hereinafter referred to as the “<b>Company</b>”;</p>

<p>Collectively referred to in this Agreement as the “<b>Parties</b>”, each referred to as a “<b>Party</b>”.</p>

<p>Before its Private Token Offering (“<b>PTO</b>”), the Threefold Foundation is launching an Internal Token Offering (“<b>ITO</b>”) for 
friends, family and ambassadors. In exchange for the payment of the Purchase Amount, the Company hereby issues to
the Purchaser certain digital tokens (the “internal TF Tokens” or “<b>iTFT's</b>”), which on the occurrence of the PTO will be
exchanged against digital tokens of the ThreeFold Foundation (the “<b>TF Tokens</b>” or “<b>TFT's</b>”), subject to the terms set forth below.</p>

<p><b>1. Internal Token Offering</b></p> 
<p>Subject to the terms set out hereinafter, including Purchaser’s payment of the entire Purchase Amount, the Company
sells and transfers to the Purchaser, and the Purchaser accepts and acquires, the entire rights and title to such number
of iTFT's corresponding to the above mentioned Purchase Amount (converted, as the case may be, into US Dollars
as per Section 4 below) divided by the Purchase Price.</p>
<p>Upon Company's reasonable request, the Purchaser will provide all information, including a network address to which
the iTFT's will be sent upon receipt of the Purchase Amount. The Purchaser will furthermore execute and deliver to the
Company any and all other transaction documents related to this Agreement as may be reasonably requested by the
Company, including verification of non-US/China/Canada person status under the applicable securities laws.</p>

<p><b>2. Exchange against TFT's</b></p> 
<p>If and when the ThreeFold Foundation’s Private Token Offering takes place, any and all iTFT's held by the Purchaser
will automatically be converted into a corresponding number of TFT's on the first day of the PTO.</p>  

<p><b>3. Lock-up Period</b></p> 
<p>Unless explicitly agreed to by the Company or the ThreeFold Foundation, Purchaser will not be allowed to sell or
transfer the iTFT's purchased under this Agreement for a period of six months after the date of this Agreement. Any
TFT’s acquired by Purchaser upon conversion of its iTFT’s into TFT’s shall be made subject to the same lock-up period
as the original iTFT’s acquired by Purchaser.</p>
<p>During such six months lock-up period, however, the Purchaser shall still be entitled to:</p>
<ol class="ol-alpha">
    <li>use the iTFT's and/or TFT's to purchase IT capacity on the ThreeFold Grid through the ThreeFold Directory; and</li>
    <li>transfer iTFT's and/or TFT’s to a person or entity that already owns iTFT’s or TFT’s immediately prior to such transfer.</li>
</ol>
<p><b>4. Payment</b></p> 
<p>The Company will accept payment for the iTFT's purchased under this Agreement in U.S. Dollars and Bitcoin. Purchaser
shall make the required payment to the Company in consideration for Purchaser’s purchase of the Right pursuant to
the Agreement by wire transfer to the Company within three business days as from the Effective Date, as follows:<p>
<ul>
	<li>when using Bitcoin: to the Company’s BitCoin wallet hosted by BitOasis Technologies FZE, at the following digital address: <b>3GTf7gWhvWqfsurxXpEj6DU7SVoLM3wC6A</b> (the “<b>Wallet</b>”); or</li> 
    <li>when using U.S. Dollars: to the Company’s bank account at Mashreq Bank, IBAN: <b>AE23 0330 0000 1912 0028 156</b> SWIFT/BIC: <b>BOMLAEAD</b></li>
</ul>

<p>For purposes of this Agreement, the value of the Purchase Amount shall be deemed in U.S. Dollar even when the
Purchaser pays in Bitcoin. On the day on which the Bitcoin payment has been received by the Company in its Wallet,
the Purchase Amount will be converted in United Arab Emirates Dirham (AED) first at the conversion rate quoted on
the website of BitOasis Technologies FZE, and then immediately thereafter from AED in U.S. Dollars at the conversion
rate quoted on the website of Oanda.com, both on such date at 11.59 PM Gulf Standard Time.</p>

<p><b>5. Disclaimer</b></p> 
<p><b>THE COMPANY MAKES NO WARRANTY WHATSOEVER, NEITHER IN ITS OWN NAME NOR IN THE NAME OF
THE THREEFOLD FOUNDATION, WITH RESPECT TO THE iTFT's AND/OR THE TFT's, INCLUDING ANY (i)
WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY; (ii) WARRANTY OF FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE; (iii)
WARRANTY OF TITLE; OR (iv) WARRANTY AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS
OF A THIRD PARTY; WHETHER ARISING BY LAW, COURSE OF DEALING, COURSE OF PERFORMANCE, USAGE
